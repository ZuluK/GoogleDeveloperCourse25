Use the map() method to take the array of bill amounts shown below,

/*
Print out the new totals array using console.log.

TIP: Check out the toFixed() method for numbers to help with rounding the values to a maximum of 2 decimal places.
Note, that the method returns a string to maintain the "fixed" format of the number.
So, if you want to convert the string back to a number, you can cast it or convert it back to a number:

 * Programming Quiz: I Got Bills (6-9)
 *
 * Use the .map() method to take the bills array below and create a second array
 * of numbers called totals. The totals array should contains each amount from the
 * bills array but with a 15% tip added. Log the totals array to the console.
 *
 * For example, the first two entries in the totals array would be:
 *
 * [57.76, 21.99, ... ]
 *
 * Things to note:
 *  - each entry in the totals array must be a number
 *  - each number must have an accuracy of two decimal points
